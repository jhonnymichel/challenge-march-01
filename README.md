# challenge-march-01: A Clock app!

This is the challenge for march's first week. we must build a clock application with three functions:

1) show time

2) set alarms (it's ok if they work only when the tab is opened :grin:)

3) stopwatch (it's ok if you don't implement laps)

## How to participate
1) Fork the branch with your name (https://github.com/potengijs/challenge-march-01/branches) to your personal github account (Don't fork it to this organization)

2) Once you're done, you can submit a pull request to the branch inside this repository. It's encouraged to submit pull requests once you finish a part of the app, instead of only showing it to us once you finish it all.

## Deadline
March 5th. So we have one entire week to develop the project.

## Challenge specific rules
### Javascript Only
The solution must be done in client using javascript. it has to be an SPA.
### You can't use any time related libraries.
Everything related to the core function of the app must be done all by yourself.

## Stuff you can use
### You can use utils libs
It's ok to use lodash or underscore. Actually, why wouldn't one use one of these in all situations?

## Stuff you can use, but we disencourage
The reason is simple: They provide you some kind of built in structure to use, while when using pure JS, you have to think of it yourself. you will learn more this way.
### MVC Frameworks
Angular, Angular 2, VUE, ~~Ember~~...
### View libraries
React, Jquery, whatever.

## General Rules
### Make the app pretty and responsive. 
use CSS libraries of any sort if you want. -- Unless the Challenge specific rules say the contrary
### Use ES6 or earlier.
it doesn't matter if you use it without transpiling as long as it runs on the latest version of all browsers excluding internet explorer. Check compatibility at http://www.caniuse.com or https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
